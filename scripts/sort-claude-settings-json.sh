# Restore etc/claude-code/settings.json to a canonical top-level key order.
#
# Claude Code rewrites this entire file whenever it persists a settings
# change (plugin toggles, /config changes, theme/model switches, etc.) by
# deserializing into its internal settings object and re-serializing the
# whole thing back out. The resulting key order follows Claude Code's own
# internal schema, not this file's prior order and not any lexical sort —
# so every app-driven write scrambles the top level differently.
#
# This script only reorders TOP-LEVEL keys. Nested objects (hooks lifecycle
# order, permissions allow/deny/ask grouping) are left untouched, since they
# already carry deliberate, meaningful ordering.
#
# Usage: ./sort-claude-settings-json.sh [path-to-settings.json]

# Canonical order: an importance-ranked narrative for a human reading the
# file top-to-bottom, not an alphabetical or schema-derived order. Read as:
# how much does this key change what Claude Code actually does, most
# impactful first, ending with the setting least likely to ever matter.
#
#   $schema                - boilerplate; universal convention to lead with
#   permissions             - gates what Claude can do; most-consulted block
#   hooks                   - automated side effects on every session
#   enabledPlugins           - capability surface (extra MCP tools/skills)
#   attribution              - visible external behavior (commit/PR trailers)
#   autoMemoryEnabled          - feature toggle with a documented rationale
#   showThinkingSummaries        - UI toggle
#   spinnerTipsEnabled            - UI toggle
#   theme                          - UI toggle
#   verbose                         - logging verbosity toggle
#   cleanupPeriodDays                 - disk-retention housekeeping; set once,
#                                       least behaviorally interesting key here
#
# Any key not listed here (e.g. a new setting Claude Code introduces) is
# appended afterward in alphabetical order, so nothing is silently dropped.
