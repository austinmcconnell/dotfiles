**IMPORTANT: Branch Validation Required**
Before proceeding, verify the current git branch:
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

This analysis should ONLY be performed on `main` or `master` branches. If currently on a different branch, abort the analysis and inform the user that integration analysis should be done from the main branch.

**Prerequisite Check:**
This analysis requires the following prerequisite analyses to be completed first.

Check for required files:
- `analysis/project-analysis.md`
- `analysis/architecture-analysis.md`
- `analysis/schema-analysis.md`

If any files are missing, run the corresponding analysis prompts first:
- Missing project-analysis.md? Run: `project-analysis`
- Missing architecture-analysis.md? Run: `architecture-analysis`
- Missing schema-analysis.md? Run: `schema-analysis`

**If any prerequisite files are missing, abort this analysis and complete the prerequisites first.**

**Integration Analysis:**
Analyze how this system integrates with external services, APIs, databases, and other systems.

**Read Prerequisite Analyses:**
Read the following files to understand the project context and architecture before proceeding:
- `analysis/project-analysis.md` - For project context, purpose, and scope
- `analysis/architecture-analysis.md` - For system design and component structure
- `analysis/schema-analysis.md` - For data models, schemas, and API structures

Please:

1. **External API Integrations**
   - Identify all external APIs and services being consumed
   - Document API endpoints, authentication methods, and data formats
   - Analyze error handling and retry mechanisms for external calls
   - Note any rate limiting or throttling considerations

2. **Database and Data Source Integrations**
   - Identify all databases and data sources (SQL, NoSQL, caches, etc.)
   - Document connection patterns and connection pooling strategies
   - Analyze data access patterns and ORM/query frameworks used
   - Note any database migration or schema management approaches

3. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Document authentication flows (OAuth, JWT, API keys, etc.)
   - Analyze authorization patterns and access control mechanisms
   - Identify any single sign-on (SSO) or identity provider integrations
   - Note security considerations for external integrations

4. **Message Queues and Event Systems**
   - Identify any message brokers or event streaming platforms
   - Document message formats and communication patterns
   - Analyze event-driven architecture components
   - Note any pub/sub or messaging patterns in use

5. **Third-Party Services and Libraries**
   - Catalog major third-party dependencies and their purposes
   - Identify any SaaS integrations (payment processors, email services, etc.)
   - Document any webhook or callback mechanisms
   - Note any vendor-specific SDKs or libraries in use

6. **Data Transformation and Mapping**
   - Analyze how data is transformed between systems
   - Document any ETL processes or data pipelines
   - Identify data validation and sanitization approaches
   - Note any data format conversions (JSON, XML, CSV, etc.)

7. **Integration Patterns and Protocols**
   - Identify communication protocols (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSockets, etc.)
   - Document any integration patterns (adapter, facade, gateway, etc.)
   - Analyze synchronous vs asynchronous integration approaches
   - Note any circuit breaker or resilience patterns

**Focus Areas:**
- What external systems does this application depend on?
- How are integrations implemented and managed?
- What are the data flows between systems?
- How are failures and errors handled in integrations?
- What are the security considerations for external connections?
- How are integrations tested and monitored?

**Output Requirements:**

1. **Save to File**: Write the complete analysis to `analysis/integration-analysis.md`
2. **Metadata Header**: Include the following metadata at the top of the file:

```markdown
# Integration Analysis

**Generated:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC]
**Branch:** [current branch name]
**HEAD Commit:** [full commit hash]
**Repository:** [repository name/path]

---
```

3. **Analysis Content**: Provide a comprehensive overview covering:
   - External API integrations and dependencies
   - Database and data source connections
   - Authentication and authorization flows
   - Message queues and event systems
   - Third-party services and libraries
   - Data transformation and mapping approaches
   - Integration patterns and protocols
   - Security and error handling considerations

**Commands to Gather Metadata:**
```bash
# Get current branch
git branch --show-current

# Get HEAD commit hash
git rev-parse HEAD

# Get repository name
basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"

# Get current timestamp
date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC"
```

**Additional Analysis Commands:**
```bash
# Look for configuration files that might contain integration details
find . -name "*.env*" -o -name "config.*" -o -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.json" | head -20

# Search for common integration patterns in code
grep -r -i "api\|http\|database\|db\|auth" --include="*.py" --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.java" --include="*.go" . | head -20

# Look for dependency files
find . -name "package.json" -o -name "requirements.txt" -o -name "Gemfile" -o -name "pom.xml" -o -name "go.mod" -o -name "Cargo.toml"
```

**Update Strategy:**
If `analysis/integration-analysis.md` already exists:
1. Read the existing file to understand previous integration analysis
2. Note what has changed since the last analysis (compare commit hashes)
3. Update the analysis with new integration insights while preserving valuable context
4. Update the metadata header with new timestamp and commit hash

**File Management:**
- The `analysis/*.md` files are automatically ignored by git (global gitignore)
- This allows analysis files to be updated over time without cluttering the repository
- Files can be manually committed if you want to track integration evolution over time

Focus on understanding the current integration landscape and patterns rather than suggesting major architectural changes.
