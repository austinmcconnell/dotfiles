Help me create a refactoring plan for the following code. Analyze the current implementation and suggest improvements.

**Please provide:**

1. **Current State Analysis**
   - Identify code smells, anti-patterns, or technical debt
   - Assess complexity, maintainability, and performance issues
   - Note any violations of SOLID principles or best practices

2. **Refactoring Strategy**
   - Break down the refactoring into safe, incremental steps
   - Prioritize changes by impact and risk
   - Identify dependencies between different refactoring tasks

3. **Specific Improvements**
   - Extract methods/classes where appropriate
   - Simplify complex conditionals or loops
   - Improve naming and code organization
   - Reduce duplication and improve reusability

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify high-risk changes that need extra testing
   - Suggest areas where feature flags might be useful
   - Recommend rollback strategies

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - What tests should be added before refactoring
   - How to verify behavior remains unchanged
   - Integration points that need special attention

**Output Format:**
- Write the complete plan in markdown format
- Save to a file named `plan-refactor-[component].md` in the project root
- Include a table of contents for easy navigation
- Use checkboxes for actionable items to track progress

**Goal:** Create a step-by-step plan that improves code quality while minimizing risk of introducing bugs.
