# Sprint Ceremonies Deep Dive

This document provides detailed guidance on SCRUM ceremonies, their purposes, best practices, and
how to facilitate them effectively.

## Sprint Planning

### Purpose and Goals

- **Primary Purpose**: Plan the work to be performed during the upcoming Sprint
- **Key Goals**:
  - Define the Sprint Goal
  - Select Product Backlog items for the Sprint
  - Create a plan for delivering the selected work
  - Ensure team commitment to the Sprint deliverables

### Duration and Participants

- **Duration**: Maximum 8 hours for a one-month Sprint (proportionally less for shorter Sprints)
  - 2-week Sprint: 4 hours maximum
  - 1-week Sprint: 2 hours maximum
- **Participants**: Entire Scrum Team (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team)
- **Optional Attendees**: Stakeholders may be invited to provide input

### Two-Part Structure

#### Part 1: What (First Half)

**Focus**: What will be delivered in the Sprint?

**Activities**:

1. **Review Sprint Goal**: Product Owner proposes Sprint Goal
2. **Review Product Backlog**: Examine top-priority items
3. **Select Stories**: Development Team selects items they can commit to
4. **Capacity Planning**: Consider team availability and velocity
5. **Clarify Requirements**: Ask questions about selected items

**Outcomes**:

- Sprint Goal is defined and agreed upon
- Product Backlog items are selected for the Sprint
- Initial Sprint Backlog is created

#### Part 2: How (Second Half)

**Focus**: How will the selected work be accomplished?

**Activities**:

1. **Task Breakdown**: Break stories into tasks
2. **Estimate Tasks**: Estimate effort for individual tasks
3. **Identify Dependencies**: Note any dependencies between tasks
4. **Assign Initial Work**: Team members volunteer for initial tasks
5. **Validate Commitment**: Ensure the plan is realistic

**Outcomes**:

- Detailed Sprint Backlog with tasks
- Clear understanding of how work will be accomplished
- Team commitment to Sprint deliverables

### Best Practices

#### Preparation

- **Product Owner Preparation**:
  - Prioritize Product Backlog
  - Ensure top stories meet Definition of Ready
  - Prepare to explain business value and requirements
  - Have acceptance criteria clearly defined

- **Development Team Preparation**:
  - Review upcoming backlog items
  - Identify any questions or concerns
  - Consider technical dependencies and risks
  - Review team capacity for the Sprint

#### During the Meeting

- **Stay Focused**: Keep discussions relevant to Sprint Planning
- **Time-box Discussions**: Limit detailed technical discussions
- **Document Decisions**: Capture important decisions and assumptions
- **Encourage Participation**: Ensure all team members contribute
- **Be Realistic**: Don't overcommit; leave buffer for unexpected work

#### Sprint Goal Creation

- **Collaborative**: Entire team should contribute to Sprint Goal
- **Specific**: Goal should be specific enough to guide decisions
- **Valuable**: Goal should deliver meaningful value to users/business
- **Achievable**: Goal should be realistic given team capacity
- **Inspiring**: Goal should motivate the team

### Common Anti-Patterns

- **Over-planning**: Spending too much time on detailed task planning
- **Under-preparation**: Starting without properly refined backlog
- **Scope Creep**: Adding work during planning without removing other work
- **Individual Assignments**: Assigning all work to specific individuals upfront
- **Ignoring Capacity**: Not considering team member availability

## Daily Scrum

### Purpose and Goals

- **Primary Purpose**: Synchronize team activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours
- **Key Goals**:
  - Share progress toward Sprint Goal
  - Identify impediments
  - Adapt the Sprint plan as needed
  - Maintain team alignment and communication

### Format and Structure

- **Duration**: 15 minutes maximum (time-boxed)
- **Participants**: Development Team (required), others may observe
- **Frequency**: Every working day at the same time and place
- **Format**: Each team member addresses three questions:
  1. What did I do yesterday that helped the team meet the Sprint Goal?
  2. What will I do today to help the team meet the Sprint Goal?
  3. Do I see any impediments that prevent me or the team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

### Best Practices

#### Meeting Management

- **Start on Time**: Begin promptly even if not everyone is present
- **Stay Standing**: Keep the meeting short and focused
- **Focus on Sprint Goal**: Relate all updates to the Sprint Goal
- **Identify, Don't Solve**: Note impediments but don't solve them in the meeting
- **Keep it Brief**: Each person should speak for 1-2 minutes maximum

#### Communication Guidelines

- **Speak to the Team**: Address the team, not the Scrum Master
- **Be Specific**: Provide concrete updates, not vague statements
- **Be Honest**: Share real progress and genuine impediments
- **Stay Relevant**: Focus on work related to the Sprint
- **Ask for Help**: Don't hesitate to request assistance

#### Impediment Management

- **Identify Clearly**: Describe impediments specifically
- **Categorize**: Distinguish between blockers and challenges
- **Assign Ownership**: Determine who will address each impediment
- **Set Timeframes**: Establish when impediments will be resolved
- **Follow Up**: Track impediment resolution outside the meeting

### Variations and Adaptations

#### Walking the Board

Instead of the three questions, team walks through the Sprint board:

1. Review items in "Done" column
2. Discuss items in "In Progress"
3. Plan items to start from "To Do"
4. Identify any blockers or impediments

#### Focus on Sprint Goal

Structure discussion around Sprint Goal progress:

1. How are we progressing toward the Sprint Goal?
2. What risks do we see to achieving the Sprint Goal?
3. What do we need to do today to stay on track?

### Common Anti-Patterns

- **Status Meeting**: Turning it into a status report for the Scrum Master
- **Problem Solving**: Attempting to solve problems during the meeting
- **Going Over Time**: Allowing the meeting to exceed 15 minutes
- **Skipping When People Are Absent**: Canceling when team members are unavailable
- **Lack of Focus**: Discussing work not related to the current Sprint
