# User Story Review Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing user stories to ensure they meet quality standards and SCRUM best practices.

## Story Structure Review

### Basic Template Compliance

- [ ] **User Role**: Story clearly identifies the type of user (persona)
- [ ] **Goal/Want**: Story clearly states what the user wants to accomplish
- [ ] **Benefit/Value**: Story explains why the user wants this (the value/benefit)

- [ ] **Flexible Ordering**: Story can be prioritized independently of other stories
- [ ] **Self-Contained**: Story includes all necessary context and information

### Negotiable

- [ ] **Right Level of Detail**: Not too specific (leaves room for implementation decisions)

### Small

- [ ] **Sprint-Sized**: Can be completed within one Sprint
- [ ] **1-3 Days Work**: Typically represents 1-3 days of development effort
- [ ] **Not an Epic**: Doesn't require breaking down into smaller stories
- [ ] **Focused Scope**: Addresses a single piece of functionality

### Testable

- [ ] **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable criteria for completion

- [ ] **Vague Criteria**: Criteria are unclear or unmeasurable
- [ ] **Too Detailed**: Criteria specify implementation details
- [ ] **Incomplete Coverage**: Important scenarios are missing
- [ ] **Conflicting Criteria**: Criteria contradict each other

### Process Problems

## Review Actions

### When Story Passes Review
