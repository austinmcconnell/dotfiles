### Example: Data Processing Improvement

```text
As a healthcare data integration specialist,
I want FHIR bundle processing to use the organization referenced in the observations (primary care provider)
so that screenings are correctly attributed to the appropriate healthcare provider instead of the first organization found.

Background
Analysis of real-world SHIN-NY bundles reveals that the current provider lookup logic treats all organizations equally and returns the first match found. However, the observations in these bundles reference a specific performing organization that should be used as the primary care provider.

Current Issue
• Provider lookup processes organizations sequentially and returns the first match found
• Ignores the fact that observations reference a specific performing organization
• Can result in screenings being attributed to technology platforms or payers instead of the actual care provider

Acceptance Criteria

Core Functionality
• [ ] Observation-Referenced Organization: System identifies which organization is referenced in the Observation resources as the performing organization
• [ ] Primary Provider Selection: Use the organization referenced in observations as the primary care provider for screening attribution

Technical Implementation
• [ ] Organization Reference Extraction: Extract performer references from Observation resources
• [ ] Provider Matching: Match the observation-performing organization against the provider database
```
