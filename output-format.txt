OUTPUT FORMAT (Downloadable Markdown Bundle)

Produce a small, linked doc set. Each item must be emitted as an individual Markdown attachment AND included together in a single ZIP attachment named truenas-10in-rack-kit.zip.

Files (use these exact names):
  00-README.md
  01-Executive-Summary.md
  02-Comparison-Table.md
  03-Architecture-A.md
  04-Architecture-B.md
  05-Architecture-C.md
  06-Operations-Plan.md
  07-BOMs-and-Links.md
  08-Risks-and-Pitfalls.md

Content requirements:

- 00-README.md
  - Title, date, “Last updated”, and a one-paragraph overview.
  - Linked Table of Contents to all other files.
  - Quick-start (“If you only read one page, open 01-Executive-Summary.md”).

- 01-Executive-Summary.md (≤1 page)
  - The short answer, assumptions, and the recommended path.

- 02-Comparison-Table.md
  - A single table with columns:
    Option | Rack Height | Drives Supported | Network | Boot Device |
    Est. Idle/Load (W) | Approx. Cost (USD) | Noise | Expandability | Notes (with citations)

- 03- / 04- / 05-Architecture-*.md (one per architecture)
  - Short narrative, ASCII airflow sketch, lane/port diagram.
  - 10-step build checklist (bulleted, each step ≤2 lines).
  - Link to the specific BOM section in 07-BOMs-and-Links.md.

- 06-Operations-Plan.md
  - Initial TrueNAS setup (pool/datasets/compression/autotrim), replication target from Synology, iSCSI target for Proxmox, scrub/SMART schedules.

- 07-BOMs-and-Links.md
  - US-sourced line items with links, quantity, unit price, subtotal, stock note.
  - Grouped by architecture. Flag any import-risk items and give a domestic alternative.

- 08-Risks-and-Pitfalls.md
  - Lane bottlenecks, NVMe thermals in 2U, backplane power limits, USB-boot pitfalls, noisy 40 mm fans, mitigation tips.

Download/Rendition rules:

- Attach each .md file as a downloadable artifact.
- Also attach a ZIP named truenas-10in-rack-kit.zip containing all files.
- If the platform cannot attach files, include a shell-ready block at the end that writes all files to disk (one `cat <<'EOF' > filename` per file), and a command to zip them:
  - `zip -9r truenas-10in-rack-kit.zip 0*-*.md`
- All links must be absolute URLs; include citation links inline (at the end of sentences).
- Keep images/diagrams as ASCII in the docs; no external images.

Style:

- Concise, source-backed, US pricing only.
- Headings use `#`/`##`. Tables in pure Markdown (no HTML).
- Each file starts with a 3-line header:
  - `# Title`
  - `**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD`
  - `**Last updated:** YYYY-MM-DD`
