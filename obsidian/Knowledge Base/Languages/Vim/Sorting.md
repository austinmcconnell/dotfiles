# Sorting

- `:sort`: sort all lines
- `:sort i`: sort all lines ignoring case
- `:sort u`: sort all lines and remove duplicates
- `:[range]sort`: sort all lines in [range]
- `:sort!`: reverse sort all lines

If you visually select some text (e.g. `Vap` to visually select a paragraph), you can sort using
similar commands. While in Visual Mode, press `:` and it'll prepend :`'<,'>` to refer to the first
and last line visuall selected
