# Senior Backend Interview – Technical Question Set

## Python / Code Quality

1. How do you structure Python code in larger systems to keep it maintainable? What patterns or
   practices do you rely on?
2. What are some pitfalls around mutability in Python, and how do you avoid them?
3. When is monkey patching appropriate, and when is it dangerous?

## Architecture / Design

4. In the checkout/reservation system you just designed, where can race conditions occur, and how
   would you prevent them?
5. When integrating with external APIs, how do you design for latency, rate limits, and partial
   failures? Can you give a specific example from your experience?
6. What does scaling actually mean to you? Give an example of how you’ve scaled a real system.

## Distributed Systems

7. How do you test a distributed system—beyond unit tests?
8. Walk me through how you detect and recover from partial failures (e.g., one component slow or
   unhealthy).

## Software Architecture

9. What are the real tradeoffs between microservices and a monolith? When would you choose one over
   the other?
10. What does “too micro” look like in practice? Have you seen it happen?

## Judgment / Engineering Philosophy

11. When does reinventing the wheel make sense? When is it a trap?

## Candidate Questions For Me

12. Anything you'd like to ask me about the team, architecture, or the role?
